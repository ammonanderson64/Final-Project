## Stack & Queue

### Introduction

**Stack** is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure used to store the history of actions like undoing task status.
**Queue** is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure used to handle task scheduling and display.

### Stack & Queue Terminology

* **Push (Stack)**: Add an item to the top of the stack
* **Pop (Stack)**: Remove the item from the top
* **Enqueue (Queue)**: Add an item to the end of the queue
* **Dequeue (Queue)**: Remove the item at the front

### Code Usage (See `task_manager_stack_queue.cs`):

* Stack is used to track user actions for undo functionality
* Queue is used to store task input in order for display or scheduling

### Efficiency

| Operation               | Time Complexity |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Push/Pop (Stack)        | O(1)            |
| Enqueue/Dequeue (Queue) | O(1)            |

### Example Problem

Simulate a task manager where users can undo adding a task or marking it completed using a **stack**.

### Problem to Solve

Extend the task manager to include **redo functionality** using a second stack.
